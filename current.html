    So where are we now? I'm sure you're curious.
  </p>
  <p>
    My 'benefactor' was as good as his word: I was able to save my people from the rampaging shadows, as promised, and he made me incredibly powerful, as promised. I'm still far from powerful enough to release him, though he keeps making me try, and it keeps not working. My people... are no more. My parents slain by orcs, and the rest of my kind overcome by the ravages of tragedy and time, the people I was born among and was a part of are now extinct, apart from me... and I won't be the father of a new generation, regardless. Too much has changed.
  </p>
  <p>
    My patron, who still hasn't divulged his name, continues to goad me on toward greater and greater power. I struggle constantly to remain a decent person, but as years wear into decades, as decades erode into centuries, I find it harder and harder to retain my dignity, my self respect, my 'humanity', and the harder it becomes to find sources of new power that don't require despicable acts on my part to acquire. Sooner or later, I'll devolve into something as bad as It, and then I'll be lost forever, but while I still have an ounce of myself left, I'll keep fighting.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the... perks, if you want to call it that, of my new circumstances is that I cannot die in the usual sense of the word. My bond-holder doesn't want me getting out of the deal by dying, so any time I'm killed, he transports my body to some recent 'home base,' and ressurects me. It takes a lot out of me each time, and it gets harder and harder to come back from it, but I always do, and I always seem to end up stronger. It's made me fearless, and a little foolhardy, because... what's the worst that can happen?
  </p>

    I gave up on being Tarron a long time ago. It mockingly refered to me as his 'deathless guardian' at one point, so I stubbornly took the title as an honor. I translated it into the now-dead language of my people, so now I am Shivetya, the Deathless Guardian.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was right about one thing, though... once I'm strong enough to release him, I'm going to stall for as long as I'm able, and do everything in my power to put him down. I have to find a way to keep him from withdrawing his contribution, first, though. I wonder if I could make another such deal with another such power...
  </p>
  <p>
    Something to look into.
