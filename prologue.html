  <h3>
    Prologue: Shadows of the Future

    When I was born, my mother gave me a name: Tarron. I carried that name for many years, until I was... reborn. When I was reborn, my new... parent... gave me a new name. The tale is, of course, much more complex than that.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sit down, friend, and I will tell you the tale.
  </p>
  <p>
    They came in the near-lightless, pre-dawn hours. The sky was a dim, flat grey, and it was oppresively silent, owing to the heavy, motionless cloud-cover. The night watchman took one look at them, and ran as though his hair was a-fire to the town hall. He woke the Mayor, who took one look of his own, and immediately raced up the stairs of the bell tower, and began to ring it furiously.
  </p>
  <p>
    Roused by the bell's clangor, what passed for the town militia sprang, terrified, from their beds and stood to arms: half a dozen aging farmers, armed with scythes, sickles, and pitchforks, and one boy, right on the cusp of manhood, who had a bow, a dozen arrows, and about half a clue how to use them. They formed up, a feeble caricature of a skirmish line, with the Mayor and the night watchman prowling behind them, as the threat approached.
  </p>
  <p>
    The threat (which, as you will see, was not in fact <span>the</span> threat, and in fact, was not a threat at all) took the form of seven lean, gaunt figures on horseback. Swathed in black and grey leather from head to toe, riding on identical black horses, and armed only with daggers in their belts, they moved up the road toward our little town. They looked like a pack of ghastly shadows, apart from the silver claw, which clutched an uncut gem on the hilt of each dagger: rubies, sapphires, emeralds, and so on, like a strange, undulating constellation of multicolored stars drifting about in the inky darkness.
  </p>
  <p>
    The riders slowed as they approached the frightened townsfolk- by now, every one was awake, and milled about uneasily behind the militia, utterly ignoring the Mayor's pleas for everyone to go home. An uneasy foreboding hung over everyone, the way dampness from fog will cling to your skin, and no one wanted to be unprepared.
  </p>
  <p>
    "Halt, and state yer business!" The night watchman's call was meant to be bold, strong, undeniable, but instead, it came out weak, plaintive, and fearful. The riders <span>did</span> halt, but it was pretty clear to all present that it had nothing to do with the watchman's challenge.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the riders- it was impossible to tell which- called loudly, "They come with the next dawn. Take what you can carry, and leave this place. Head the same direction we do. Do not stop, do not tarry, and do not come back. This place is lost to you. Leave, with all haste, lest you be lost with it."
  </p>
  <p>
    A babble of confused, frightened voices rose up, babbling questions. The Mayor struggled futiley to quiet the townsfolk so that he could hear, so that he could speak to the riders. After a few long moments, the riders solved the problem in their own way: they began to move slowly forward, and the people scattered like minnows in the face of a pike: even the militia dropped their weapons and backed away swiftly. The Mayor and the watchman were made of slightly sterner stuff, for they stood their ground as the riders approached.
  </p>
  <p>
    "Do you speak for these people?" The rider's voice was deep, resonant, powerful, even while it was muted and muffled by the leather mask covering his face
  </p>
  <p>
    "The people speak for themselves," the Mayor replied, "But I represent them, and their interests, if that's what you mean."
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the riders, presumably the one who spoke, nodded. "Doom follows us. A shadowy, implacable doom that cannot be reasoned with, cannot be bargained with, and will not be stopped by any mortal hand. If you care for your people, tell them to take what they value and flee, and if you or any of yours believe that there are gods who care for us, any such folk should pray with their whole heart that said gods will stand forth for us, because if they do not, what pursues us will surely consume the world. It comes with the next dawn, if your luck is poor, and with the dusk tomorrow if your luck is good."
  </p>
  <p>
    The Mayor stared, trying to take this all in, still blinking crusts of sleep from his eyes. The presumptive speaker turned to the other riders, nodded, and they formed up and moved out again, riding skillfully through the crowd of people without disturbing anyone in the slightest. They were there, they were passing through, and then they were leaving. In less time then it takes to tell it, they were gone.
  </p>
  <p>
    The people began to calmor again, surrounding the Mayor and the watchman, demanding answers, demanding protection, demanding all manner of things that would help exactly not at all. The two men stared at each other, unable to speak, neither with any idea in the world what to do or how to proceed.
  </p>
  <p>
    The scene devolved into clots of townsfolk embroiled in animated discussion about the riders, what they said, whether it should be taken seriously, what the whole thing could mean, accomplishing very little. In the end, a few folks took the riders seriously, packed what they could carry, and followed the same road out of town that the riders had taken, but most adopted a wait and see approach.
  </p>
  <p>
    ...wait and see indeed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dawn came the next day and many people were gathered at the edge of town, nervously watching the horizon. They became bored with that quickly, as nothing appeared to be happening. The Mayor asked for volunteers to man a watch there, and he got a few; they drew up a schedule, and the volunteers watched in two hour shifts, in pairs, waiting to see if anything happened.
  </p>
  <p>
    Shortly after noon, the first terrified, fleeing people began to arrive. They ignored the volunteers, mostly, simply passing them by and continuing out of town on the other side; some stopped to talk, briefly, and what they said inspired fear and dread: fear of what was coming, and dread of the thought that they made a mistake, and should have left when the riders did.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the next few hours, the refugees became more and more numerous, and then the flow began to dwindle, down to a trickle... and many of the trickling stragglers began to pass through with wounds, some of them very serious, and a half dozen of them or so died as they tried to drag themselves through town.
  </p>
  <p class="botom">
    When the deaths began, so did the panic, and nothing the Mayor or the watchman said or did was of any use: people began to pack their things, and to crowd the market and the general store, fighting over supplies. In small packs, singly, and in twos and threes, people left town, headed south.
