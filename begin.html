  <h3>...it begins.</h3>
  <p>
    We traveled steadily for several weeks, part of a grand, grim parade of refugees, a river of people flowing slowly south, headed nowhere, fleeing desperately for a dark, unnamed something that bore down like nemesis. We finally hit a town that wasn't deserted: either no warning had been issued here yet, or neither the riders nor the endless flow of frightened people had been enough to coax these folks to leave. Regardless, it was a place to get off the road, even if only briefly, and take stock of our situation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sweet, sweet illusion, while it lasted. The townsfolk were friendly enough, if a little derisive of all the people fleeing from "nothing;" no one bothered to try to explain, because these people hadn't seen the injured, and the ones who simply dropped dead as they walked. Our coin was good, their prices were fair, and they were as happy for the business as we were for the supplies, the hot baths, and the soft beds.
  </p>
  <p>
    Stopping was a terrible mistake. Sometime in the night, the terrible thing that followed us caught up. In retrospect, I think it could have caught us at any time, and took pleasure from our terrified flight from our homes. I doubt I'll ever actually know, despite all the things that happened later.
  </p>
  <p>
    It started with a clatter and a fuss at the north end of town: it went from silence, business as usual, to shouting gate guards, and sleepy, frightened people staggering out of their homes, in the blink of an eye. Soon, people were running every which way, colliding often, getting in one another's way, interfering with the guard's response, and generally just contributing to the chaos, which was already immense.
  </p>
  <p>
    Shadowy flying... somethings... were swarming in from the north. About the size of a halfling, they had black bat-wings, long, sinuous limbs, and fearful claws. They had a strangely flat appearance, reflected no light, and cast no shadow of their own. They screeched and shrieked in high pitched, echoeless voices, and swopped around, chasing and attacking anything that moved. Dozens of people were dead within minutes, simply torn apart by these shadowy things. As near as we could tell, they weren't eating their victims, nor were they looting; they seemed to have no goal, no motive, other than to terrify and kill... and those things, they did very, very well.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the first sign of the chaos, my father roused my mother and I to action with desperate, hissing whispers: we gathered a few essentials, and he lead us, creeping and sneaking, away from the center of town, east and a bit south, until we reached the treeline of the nearby woods. We hustled, nearly running, striving to do so as quietly as possible, looking for a place to hide.
  </p>
  <p>
    After an indeterminate amount of time, we stumbled into some ruins: bare bones stone foundations, the odd crumbling timber, the remains of... a well? A cellar? An altar? Impossible to tell... but the place offered enough shelter to hide us. We settled in as best we could: I fell asleep, to tired to stay afraid any longer, let alone awake, and my parents took turns standing watch and trying to sleep. Cries, shouts, and screams drifted in from town even out here, and my parents stayed in a perpetual state of trembling fear.
  </p>
  <p>
    I woke sometime later, with the feeble rays of dawn just beginning to poke up from the horizon. My father was gone: he'd decided to sneak back into town and try to find some food. My mother stayed to keep watch over me, but exhaustion had overhauled her, and she'd fallen asleep despite herself. I was hungry, cold, and bored, and could no longer just sit there, so I quietly picked my way out of our makeshift hidey-hole, and began to explore.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was too young to really have any idea what I was looking at, mostly, other than that it was the remains of, most likely, several buildings. Looking back, I believe now that a keep of some sort once stood there, or a fort, some sort of fortified installation, but all that was left were parts of the foundation and other odd remnants. I wandered for quite a while, looking for something interesting, throwing rocks into the trees, and hoping my father would come back soon with something to eat.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the time, it seemed like chance, like the pure, stupid rumblings and bumblings of chance, but thinking about it now... I'm not so sure. Was I pulled? Was I being called, with some still, quiet voice I couldn't even hear? Was it fate? I'm no longer sure at all, and, really, it doesn't matter, not anymore. I found a piece of a wall that had miraculously survived the years, complete with a rotting doorframe. The rusted hinges were still present, though they looked as though the slightest touch would cause them to crumble.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my mind's eye, I was suddenly an intrepid explorer, seeking adventure and riches in some overgrown dungeon. I stepped through the ruined doorway (in my mind, a sword in one hand and a crossbow in the other), and found a faint but visible path leading down a deceptively steep hill into the trees (in my mind, I was hunkered down, squinting narrowly at the ground, looking for tracks, sniffing for the scent of dark, wicked things). Imagination and curiousity were in full swing, and took my mind off of being cold and hungry, so I carefully shuffled down the path.
  </p>
  <p>
    The trees above me seemed to lean further and further in as I followed the trail, until the branches from either side wove together to make a leafy, wooded ceiling, and it grew almost completely dark. By the time I began to feel uneasy, it was really too late. I reached the end of the path, which came rather abruptly, and emerged into what was almost an underground clearing: it wasn't <span>really</span> underground, it just seemed so because of the tangle of trees above me.
  </p>
  <p>
    The clearing was perhaps thirty feet across, almost uniformly circular, and nearly empty. The ground was covered in what appeared to be dead grass, brown and dry, which struck me as rather strange- "You'd think that this place would get all kinds of rain runoff," I thought to myself. Almost empty, I said: in the center of the clearing stood what I at first mistook for an old tree stump. As I got closer, though, I saw that it wasn't a stump at all, but rather a cylindrical stone pillar, about three feet across and about four feet tall. I approached the curious stone furnishing, no longer sure if I was walking or being pulled, no longer sure if I wanted to be here, and fairly sure that none of that mattered.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I drew near, I could see that the pillar had a ring of tiny runes carved around it's rim. I marveled momentarily at how much skill, and time, would have been required to complete such an intricate carving, and I wondered, too, what the runes said, for they were not in any language, or indeed any alphabet, that I knew. All that in the space of seconds, and all that flushed hopelessly from my mind when I saw... it.
  </p>
  <p>
    It... the reason I am still alive, the reason I writhe in endless torment, the reason why the world survived, and, at least in part, the reason why it is still doomed. On the stone pillar, in the ring of carved runes, at the center of that hidden clearing, was a necklace.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not a necklace, on second look: a sturdy chain, made of what looked like iron, with a pendant attached, made of what looked like silver, chased with gold. It was a cunning bit of work, truly, though I couldn't much appreciate it then: I was terrified of the thing, and obsessed with it. That I should leave it there and walk away, of that I had no doubt, just as I knew that I hadn't the ability to do any such thing. I stepped forward, and with a trembling hand, I lifted it from the pillar, and held it up to examine it more closely.
  </p>
  <p>
    The pendant was a cunning thing, as I said: roughly a cube, it looked like a different thing depending on which direction you peered at it from: one side looked like a seven pointed star, with a ruby in the center; another looked like a series of offset squares, each ninty degrees removed from the one before it. There was a series of close set, finely engraved, concentric circles, an eye with a blue sapphire in it's center, what looked like a claw with tiny obsidian chips for nails, and a plain old triangle. I could have sworn, too, that the relationship of the symbols changed from viewing to viewing, but for some reason, my attempts to confirm this always ended with me confused and headachey.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'll never really know, I don't guess, why I did it, but I slipped the thing over my head, and tucked it under my shirt. As I did so, I heard a faint, distant voice, tinged with fear: "Tarrrrrrronnnnnnnnn!" It was my mother: she'd awakened, and was panicing because she didn't know where I was. I hustled back out of the weird little clearing, and back up the path, through the door, and toward where we'd been hiding. As I crossed the threshold, I glanced back...
  </p>
  <p>
    ...and the path was gone. The hill was gone. The doorway opened onto the treeline, and none of what I'd just seen was there. I touched the strange, bulky pendant under my shirt, making sure I hadn't dreamed the whole thing or something, but it was still there. I hastily made my way back to our makeshift camp, and apologetically endured my mother's angry, relieved lecture about running off and the consequences thereof.
  </p>
  <p>
    When she was done hollering at me, I asked, "Where's dad?"
  </p>
  <p>
    She frowned, and said, "I don't know. I really expected and hoped he'd be back by now." Clearly frightened and close to tears, she turned away, pretending to be scanning the trees.
  </p>
  <p>
    "Should we go look for him?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
    She glanced back at me, wide-eyed, then regained control. She seemed to think for a moment, then said, "Not 'we', no. I'll go see if I can find him; you stay here in case I miss him and he comes back. I don't want him to think we left, or that something bad happened."
  </p>
  <p>
    I didn't like this idea much, but I knew better than to argue. She admonished me to stay put, and promised to be back within the hour, one way or the other. She glanced around once more, as though hoping that father would miraculously walk up right then, shook her head, and headed back toward town.
  </p>
  <p>
    I sat there, alone, cold, hungry, bored, and, really, afraid, for a little while, legs pulled up against my chest with my arms wrapped around them, trying to stay warm, or what passed for it. I was just about to the end of my patience and beginning to think about wandering around again, when I heard it.
  </p>
  <p>
    "Your people are in great peril."
  </p>
  <p>
    I jumped, startled, and looked around. There was no one there, no one I could see, anyway. "Who's there?" I cried hoarsely. "Where are you? Show yourself!"
  </p>
  <p>
    The voice chuckled merrily. "I would show myself, if I could, but my lamentable circumstances have rendered me unable to do so; indeed, most of the luxurious advantages you enjoy and take for granted are currently denied me... but there are things I <span>can</span> do, and perhaps we can help one another."
  </p>
  <p>
    I narrowed my eyes and furrowed my brow. "I'm imagining this, aren't I? I'm too tired, too hungry, too cold, and I've been scared for too long, so I'm hearing things. That's what it is... isn't it?" I finished weakly, hopefully, because for some reason, the merry, chuckling voice made me deeply uneasy.
  </p>
  <p>
    It spoke again: "I've been waiting a long time for someone like you, Tarron. I wish I could just answer all your questions, and have a normal, civil chat about the nature of things and the state of the world, but alas, there isn't time. Something dark and evil this way comes, lad, and unless you want to be trampled in it's path, alongside everything and everyone you hold dear, you need to listen to me, and help me, so that I can help you."
  </p>
  <p>
    That was a lot to get down in one bite, and I wasn't sure how to respond; fortunately, the voice didn't wait; rather, it kept talking.
  </p>
  <p>
    "A long, long time ago, as your people reckon time, I had a falling out with some of my allies, and things devolved quickly into war. Though I was, and am, quite powerful as my kind go, I was overcome, and had my soul bound into this amulet. As numerous and powerful as my enemies were, that was the most they could do: they couldn't destroy me outright. They took the amulet, and hid it in a magical place, designed so that it could only be seen by someone with enough power to not need mine. In other words, they locked me up and threw away the key... or so they though."
  </p>
  <p>
    "Long centuries passed, as I waited for someone with the power to see where I was, and the good sense, or good will, to let me out, to come along. There were a few close calls..." The voice trailed off for along moment, and I almost thought I heard a wistful sigh. "There were those with the power, there were those with the sense, there were those with the will... but never all at once. So here I sat, trapped, unable to release myself, and unable to communicate with any who lacked the necessary power and temprament."
  </p>
  <p>
    "Then you came along, Tarron, and you and I are going to be <span>very</span> good friends. You have the power to release me from my prison- indeed, you've already taken the first step- and I have the ability to make you strong enough to stand up to the horror that comes to end your people."
  </p>
  <p>
    I frowned, and said, "What do you mean?"
  </p>
  <p>
    "Again, my son, time grows very short. In a scant matter of hours, the shadows that ravaged that town, and all the ones north of it, will continue to surge south, and west, and east, and in every direction, and they will destroy everything. Your parents were foolish to go back into town, and if you want to save them, you cannot afford to dilly-dally or drag your feet. I can empower you to save them. You can, with that power, help me effect my release. Do we have a bargain?"
  </p>
  <p>
    I thought for a moment. "I have one question, first. Why me? Why was I able to see you, or whatever? I'm not special."
  </p>
  <p>
    "Ah, Tarron, but you <span>are</span> special. Long ago, many, many generations back, one of your ancestors made a bargain, much like the one we're about to make, with a powerful being, much like myself, only much more so. That anscestor became... stained, let's say, by that power, so much so that it altered her on a physical level, and she passed that stain, that power, to her children, and they to theirs, and so on. Every single member of your family tree who could trace their ancestry back to her carried that altered bloodline, and in theory, any of them could have become amazing things, if that powerful blood had been given a chance to awaken. Sadly, it never was, until now. The blood that runs through your veins has the potential to make you something great, something amazing, and with my help, my gifts, you can be even more than that. You need simmply to accept my offer. We will save your people, stop this creeping shadow, and then, once your power has fully emerged you will have the necessary skills to set me free."
  </p>
  <p>
    The thought of being a powerful... what? Wizard? Sorcerer? Magus? Whatever, what I called it wouldn't matter, the thought of being powerful was hard to resist... and the thought of being powerful <span>and</span> able to save my family was undeniable. "Very well," I said. "Awaken my blood, or whatever, and show me how to do amazing things, and I'll try to let you out."
  </p>
  <p>
    The voice erupted in a victorious, horrible cackle. "The deal is struck, the bargain made, and the pact sealed. We take the first steps!" With that, the amulet around my neck grew warm, almost unbearably so, and my head began to ring, to swim, to pound, as strange images, runes, languages, and names swirled in my mind. My heart hammered harder and harder, and I was afraid I was going to die. I fell to my knees, unable to stay on my feet. Dizzy nauseous, and suddenly, terribly afraid, I collapsed on the ground.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I awoke, I was no longer in the ruins where we'd hidden, I was in a nondescript room, lying in a moderately comortable bed. I felt as though I'd just awakened from an awful dream, and I struggled to take stock: I wasn't cold, or hungry, and I wasn't in the middle of nowhere outside. I couldn't hear any screaming or crying or yelling... maybe the whole thing was a dream- so vivid, though!
  </p>
  <p>
    I sat, and stretched... and felt the cold metal of the chain, the warm metal of the pendant against my skin. Not a dream at all, then...
  </p>
  <p>
    The voice said, "Ah, you're awake. Splendid. We have much to do: you have much to learn, to understand, and we have far to travel, so we must get started immediately. I know you have an endless parade of questions, so let me fill you in on the salient details, then we really must go."
  </p>
  <p>
    I nodded, more confused than ever and vaguely wondering if my new "friend" could see me as well as hear me.
  </p>
  <p>
    "After I infused you with power, effectively waking your sorcerous blood, you rose up, like a force of nature, and took the fight to the shadows. A raw, untrained, unpracticed force of nature, to be sure, but your fury was undeniable. You drove the shadows back, and back, and in the end, they simply went back to where they came from when they saw that they couldn't beat you. The survivors from the town began putting things back together, and your parents left the next day, headed back to your hometown. They were dreadfully sad that they had to go without you, but they couldn't find you in the aftermath, and hadn't recognized you during your rampage. I doubt they'd take kindly to your... transformation, so it seemed best to let them go. Sadly, orcs have been preying on travelers, and your parents were killed by them on the trip."
  </p>
  <p>
    I started, shocked by the nonchalance that this was delivered with, and I cried, "What?! You said if I took your deal, I could save them!"
  </p>
  <p>
    The voice chuckled malevolently. "Ah, but you <span>did</span> save them, Tarron. You routed the shadows and kept them from swallowing up the whole world. The orcs... they were an accident, albiet a happy one, and they were neither part of our bargain nor our negotiations."
  </p>
  <p>
    I shook with sorrow and fury. "A happy one? What do you mean?"
  </p>
  <p>
    "Naive child, you have much to learn. Simply put, with no emotional ties to this world remaining, you have nothing to drive you but the desire to become stronger. I have no doubt that you'll scheme about ways to leave me where I am, but our bargain precludes that- if you try to renege, you'll be compelled to fulfill your end. You might also think about trying to become strong enough to defeat me once I'm free; I encourage this, really- I would welcome a challenge and a warmup once I'm loose again." The voice laughed again, an evil, horrible sound.
  </p>
  <p>
    All I could do was sit there and shake.
