    Shivetya, the Deathless Guardian, is a human sorcer-witch. He has the Occult bloodline, and a Vengence patron.
  </p>
  <p>
    Said patron is, mostly unbeknownst to Shivetya, a fairly powerful Devil, which has been bound into the amulet that Shivetya found, which also functions as his familiar. It was hidden in a pocket of magical space, but those who bound the devil into the amulet were unable to fully suppress his power: the devil was able to create a doorway into the magical pocket he was hidden in, enabling someone with the appropriate power to enter.
  </p>
  <p>
    The devil did indeed give Shivetya enough power to overcome the shadows that were swarming over his homeland, and while the devil had nothing directly to do with the orcs attacking his people, he <span>did</span> know about it, and chose to neiher intervene nor to inform Shivetya so he could, effectively allowing his parents to die.
  </p>
  <p>
    While Shivetya isn't evil himself (yet), he is aware of the inherently evil nature of his patron, and feels tremendous guilt over what he sees as having mishandled his negotiations therewith, and he continues to do... questionable things in the pursuit of more power. He also is actively, if secretly, searching for a new patron- whether that be a second such power, or one with the ability to aid him against the devil in the amulet, he's not particular.
  </p>
  <p>
    Shivetya has not sought out a sorcerous familiar, because he believes that he cannot have both his amulet and such a being at the same time; that said, if he learned otherwise, or was approached by a useful creature that wanted to serve him, he would seek or accept such.
